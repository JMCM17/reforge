# Reforge: Rise of the Seventeen Cities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reforge: Rise of the Seventeen Cities is an RPG game created using the Java language whilst implementing Java Swing modules. It showcases 25 items, 8 pets, 20 bosses, 18 cities, and a compelling storyline. The program allows the user to travel to those 18 cities and learn more about the problem they’re facing, and is equipped with 4 items to beat 3 bosses of each city. After defeating a boss, a loot will be dropped containing resources such as: gold, iron, herb, biscuit, and diamond. This can be used to buy new items or fund programs to help the city progress.

3. **Eldoria** (Capital City)\
\- Marketplace (Storyline)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Maverick was known far and wide. Children playing, tourists are packing, and the residents are smiling. The marketplace was brimming with abundance and life. Until the day that the ruler must pass on the crown. Sadly, all of his successors had mysteriously died and there was no other choice but for his brother to take the throne.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance it seems that the success continues, until you take a second look and then you’ll realize. The tax has been raised, stealing from normal vendors. Not even a week’s worth of groceries is being left because of this new rule. But where does this tax go? There have been no new structures or projects since the coronation of the new king. And if the residents complain, they are being locked up by the new police chief.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present, the capital has been deserted. The children were now malnourished and sick, the tourists have lost interest, and the residents can barely survive. This corruption has left the capital in the depths of poverty and it is quickly spreading to the neighboring cities.

4. **Havenbrook** (Farm Area)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden fields. This was the scenery of the farmlands as we are the main provider of the food for the kingdom. Now, all you can see are the dreaded and dehydrated crops that can no longer be eaten. Pests have been swarming and no allocation of funds for maintenance of the food, not even salary for us farmers. What happened to this country?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just months ago, we stopped receiving orders from the capital city’s marketplace. From what we heard, even the capital city is undergoing a huge problem. Because of this, even the cash flow in our farmlands has stopped. The king didn’t even notice our cries for funds. Instead, the king wants us to continue farming and directly deliver the food to the castle. What is the king doing?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this keeps up, what will the normal people eat? Will they be able to? Or will the royalty be the only ones to have something on their plate?

5. **Amberdale** (City of Medicine)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amberdale, the city once renowned for its medical advancements both in technology and their professionals. This city once stood as a beacon of hope and health in a troubled world. People from all corners of the realm sought its care.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to the corruption that has happened in the capital, fundings has not been reaching the city. Professional doctors left the country in search for opportunities and the establishments were not being managed properly. And due to the lack of food supply, the sick people have not been able to eat and receive nutrients. The once place of recovery has now become a meeting place for sick people. Thus, the downfall of Amberdale.

6. **Academere** (City of Scholars)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Education is the foundation of a successful country”, this is the philosophy of the City of Scholars, Academere. The city that produced world-renowned professionals in various fields. However, this will all be written as another lesson in the history books.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the increased demand of doctors in Amberdale, the persons-in-charge of the universities in the Academere rushed the education of their students and thus produced half-baked “professionals”. This decision trashed the name of Academere as the City of Scholars and thus lost their credibility as an institution.

7. **Ironspire** (A Successful City)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironspire is the most successful city in the country. But success doesn’t always equate to being peaceful.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular city is being run by two large organizations split up due to gender inequality. These two organizations have been fighting constantly to rule over the city.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafia attacks, infrastructure sabotages, and even gunfights. This has been a normal scene in residents’ everyday life. So despite the city’s seemingly successful monetary trait, it is plundered by chaos caused by these two organizations which results in the lack of order and cooperation.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like Ironspire doesn’t have to wait for Eldoria’s corruption to spread in their city. They might as well be destroying themself because of their own stupidity.

8. **Willowbrook** (Riverside City)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace is where the heart is. And Willowbrook is the embodiment of peace. The Riverside City, Willowbrook, is known for its welcoming nature and hospitable residents which is why most tourists prefer to stay in the city.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Willowbrook is not only known for its peaceful nature. The city is mainly known for their clean and delicious river water which is being manufactured and marketed all around the world which is the main source of funding for the city and its residents.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, one day, one tourist got sick after drinking the famed river water. This pushed the city mayor to close the city’s borders for tourists. Couple of weeks passed by and half of the city’s population got sick and was sent to Amberdale in hopes of recovery.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon it was discovered that the river water had been contaminated, but by what? Or by who?

9. **Shadow Fall** (A Rural Town without Electricity)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the previous king’s brother was crowned, there were two large agricultural areas in the country: the Havenbrook and Oakheart. The Shadow Fall is the remnants of Oakheart’s once former glory.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the coronation and the corruption, the two huge agricultural areas suffered but were given a deal by the new king. They have to directly deliver their goods to the kingdom. But the city of Oakheart refused which led to the kingdom completely shutting down the city’s fund stream. This caused problems inside Oakheart, criminal activities have increased, poverty, lack of food, and loss of energy supply. The Oakheart was then called and known as Shadow Fall because when the sun sets down the whole city seems to fall down into the shadows due to the lack of affordable energy supply.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the residents see the light in the night once again?

10. **Rusthaven** (A City Completely Reliant on AI)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When silicone was first introduced by the ClimaVoid Research Center, the geniuses of Rusthaven decided to develop the very first advanced machinery that set foot on the land. At first it was a utopia for everyone! Jobs and efficiency is at hand. But I guess too much is, and will always be, too much.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rusthaven, with their technology, soon separated from the kingdom and built their own government and system. They became too reliant on AI and technology that even the city itself was like a whole computer interconnected to one another. Job opportunities soon diminished and were replaced by robots, this led to residents abandoning the city. Their obsession with technological advancement led them to take control of all silicone mining facilities to make sure that no one can keep up with their progress.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumor has it that their obsession even led to some of their higher-ups physically converting themselves into robots.

11. **Backwarden** (A Mining City which is Very Late in Innovation)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backwarden is the largest silicone mining city in the country. The city’s economy hit its peak when Rusthaven contracted them as their silicone supplier for the technological advancements happening in that city. However, it was also this particular city, Rusthaven, to be the reason for their economy’s downfall.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to Rusthaven's monopoly over all silicone mining areas in the country, the city of Backwarden came to a halt. Suddenly, all miners lost their jobs. And since mining is the only job in the city, when it disappeared the whole city somewhat did as well.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how advanced Rusthaven is, the Backwarden is of the same in terms of being late in innovation. Currently, the Backwarden seems to be still living in the past. The city itself seemed to stop progressing.

12. **Stonewatch** (A City Separated by a Wall Between Races)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly to Ironspire, the Stonewatch is also divided into two: the blacks and the whites. The city was called Stonewatch due to the huge stone wall separating the two races. Unlike the city of Ironspire, Stonewatch has rules and as long as both races follow those rules there’ll be no problems within the city.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how long would the elders of both races think that these peace would be enough? How long would they think until one resident strives for fairness, cooperation, and unity among diversity? If that happens will that be an opportunity for change or a catalyst for chaos?

13. **Ghosthaven** (Abandoned City)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ghosthaven was a noisy city with its cultured residents. Festivities and dances were once rampant in the city making them a hotspot for tourists. After all, this is the only thing that is worth mentioning in this city. They are so far away from civilization and resources. The tourists are the only reason why they managed to sustain their community.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tourists stopped coming to the country, so was the noise in the city. Ghosthaven suddenly grew quiet and lonely. The residents seem to just get about with their own lives, until the factories in Industria posted a mass hiring. This opportunity captivated most, if not all, the residents of the city. Leaving their hometown in pursuit of something.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, otters and insects are inhabiting the city once known for their colorful festivities. 

14. **Industria** (Central Production Area)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other cities drastically changed after the coronation, then treat Industria differently. Ever since, the city has become the main central production area of the country. With its factories, warehouses, and hardworking workers they have made it possible to consistently supply each and every city.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effect of the corruption in the other cities forced the Industria’s main factories to abandon quality and focus on quantity. The city has been producing more than what’s being consumed, leaving away any environmental measures. The factories have been contaminating the bodies of water that is flowing through the country and are constantly destroying the forests.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this continues, how long will our country’s resources can keep up with this production rate?

15. **ClimaVoid Research Center** (Worn-Down Research Facility)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you do when there is no hope? Apparently, giving up is the answer of the researchers from the ClimaVoid Research Center.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research center was first founded by the previous king once he discovered the effects of climate change. He wants to know and prevent any further calamities thus the creation of the ClimaVoid Research Center.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers have predicted a calamity that might destroy countless buildings and endanger multiple victims. They brought this up to the new king but to no avail. Ever since the coronation of the new king, funds for the research center were completely neglected. Because of this, the researchers lost hope that they could do anything about the impending calamity. They felt like they were just wasting time and effort, instead they chose to abandon the research center to be with their families if it’ll be the last time

16. **Azureport** (Fishing Port)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country is surrounded by the ocean, so normally one of the most thriving industries is the fishery. Azureport is known to be the hotspot for tourists that are interested in fishing and island hopping. But aside from being a tourist attraction, Azureport is also known by the country’s residents for its fish market. Fresh fish at low cost, what else could you ask for?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, a fisherman noticed that some of the fish had red eyes. Upon further observation, some areas of the ocean are also contaminated by what seems like oil or something. This forced the Azureport to close its docks from tourists as well as their market to prevent the spread of sickness. The pollution soon destroyed the marine ecosystem. Some of the higher-ups decided to ask help and guidance from the researchers in the ClimaVoid Research Center only to find it abandoned.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of the pollution seems to be coming from a river that connects the three cities: Azureport, Willowbrook, and Industria.

17. **Rosewood** (Deforested Area)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rosewood was the habitat for a variety of land species and the Amazon tribe. The Amazon tribe is well-known for their dark complexion and exotic culture. However, when Industria’s deforestation commenced, the Amazon tribe was transferred to the city of Stonewatch. Due to the bizarre look and way of living of the Amazons, the residents of Stonewatch despised them. Just a month ago, it was reported in the news that Stonewatch’s mayor built a huge wall for unknown purposes.

18. **Justice Central** (Center of Law and Order)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Central, the center of law and order, is a city of attorneys and lawyers. This city is part of the kingdom, but was never influenced by it. They stand their ground to being unbiased and fair to each and all cities and residents involved. The previous king commended the leaders of the Justice Central for doing a great and fair trial for all. However, upon coronation, corruption and inequality ran rampant throughout the whole country. You might think that amidst all of this, the Justice Central will remain true to its word of being fair and unbiased. But that is where you’re wrong.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threats, bribes, and lies have plagued the deepest parts of the justice system. The sad thing is, nothing can be done against this. No one wants to stand up against the justice system and anything connected with it. 
	
20. **Skyport Terminal** (Soon-to-be Airport)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that you have heard about how the tourists lost interest in this forsaken country. Well, that’s a lie. When the country’s problems had been plaguing each and every city, neighboring countries lent out a helping hand. They wanted to provide assistance in any form because the king is a good friend of most world leaders. However, when the new king was crowned, he wanted to shut down the borders of the whole country. Why? It is because he didn’t want anyone telling him what and what not to do. He doesn’t want to share the country’s resources.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these problems start with greed. And let’s face it, you can’t solve the country’s current problems alone. The reconstruction of this airport, the reopening of the borders, and the rekindling of the connection to other countries will mark the end of this all. And in the end, there shall be a new beginning.
